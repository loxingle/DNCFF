        Yellow is the color between orange and green on the spectrum of light. <br>Yellow is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 575-585 nm. <br><br>
        "Even if I have to jump over a volcano to get to you I will." -Dunia <br><br>
        "You did your best and that's all that matters." -Dunia <br><br>
        "And I'm so proud of you. I know I say that constantly but like you're so amazing, like it warms my heart to see how amazing you are." -Dunia <br><br>
        "YEAH DUNIA WILL ALWAYS PROTECT <i>STARIA ANS SUMER</i> BC <i>STARIA ANS SUMER</i> HAVE SUCH A SPECIAL PLACE IN DUNIAS HEART BC THEY ARE RLLT SPECIAL PEOPLE TO
            ME NO MATTER WHAT AGE DUNIS LOVES THEM SO MUCH SND DUNIA WOULD TAKE A BULLET FOR YOU BOTJ" -Dunia <br><br><br>
        To be there for everyone. <br>
            To never disappoint those in need of a helping hand. She can sit with one in silence if it's too much to be put into words, just to keep you as much company
            as you need. What she could ever ask from someone is for them to be happy. If she had one wish and one wish only, she would completely forget about herself.
            That is how selfless she is, she deems others' joy as her own. <br><br>
        To express her love through creativity. <br>
            She hosts different activities to make one happy. She lists down fifty reasons why she loves someone for them to keep them safe in a jar. She makes video edits!
            She sends many, many videos and pictures of something she knows one loves. She keeps everything about one stored in her brain. She keeps all of them, just to
            keep her reminded of one she loves. To make song playlists too! She does all she can to persuade you that everything will be alright. She shows you that dreams
            are meant to be chased. She talks to you about the mysteries of life and deep dark thoughts, a wonderful philosophy to keep your mind active and thinking.
            She spends time and heart to correct one's mindset when it gets too off. <br><br>
        To uplift those who had fallen down. <br>
            To say "I love you" to everyone despite do loving them? I'm afraid she does not say such a thing so easily. "I love you" she makes video edits with every
            effort she puts in. "I love you" she shows up immediately when she is needed. "I love you" she tries all she can to do the things she knows one
            is hoping for. "I love you" she accompanies you through your exhaustion, sickness, anger and woe whilst she battles her own exhaustion, sickness, anger
            and woe. "I love you" she shows the world how much she appreciates one. "I love you" she pours out all her energy and care just to fill one up. "I love you"
            she thinks about one every moment of her life. "I love you" she asks about how one is every three seconds just to make sure. "I love you" she sacrifices her
            own needs if it meant one would be happy. "I love you" she says, to someone she loves. <br><br>
        <h4>Yellow Roses.</h4>
        1. Plant yellow roses where they receive full sun with light shade in late afternoon where summers are hot. <br>
        2. Choose a spot away from large trees and other shrubs so that the rose bush isn't forced to compete for water and nutrients. <br>
        3. Before planting the rose, dig a hole as deep as the plant's root ball and fill it with water. <br>
        4. Keep the soil moist but not saturated after planting. <br><br>
        Like a yellow rose, (sun would symbolise joy) Dunia is in need of perfect joy. <br><br>
        Like a yellow rose, Dunia is in need of her own space to learn and grow. <br><br>
        Like a yellow rose, Dunia is in need of a suitable home. <br><br>
        Like a yellow rose, Dunia is in need of care. <br><br><br>
